# Event Stream Module Documentation

## Purpose
This module contains the OpenChamber message-stream WebSocket protocol and runtime bridge. It keeps the browser-facing WebSocket transport separate from the upstream OpenCode SSE transport.

## Entrypoints and structure
- `backend/server/lib/event-stream/index.js`: public entrypoint re-exporting protocol and runtime helpers.
- `backend/server/lib/event-stream/global-hub.js`: shared global upstream SSE hub for server-side subscribers and browser WS fan-out.
- `backend/server/lib/event-stream/global-ws-bridge.js`: browser-facing global WS bridge that subscribes clients to the shared global hub.
- `backend/server/lib/event-stream/directory-ws-bridge.js`: browser-facing per-directory WS bridge that owns one scoped upstream reader per connection.
- `backend/server/lib/event-stream/protocol.js`: path constants, SSE envelope parsing, and WebSocket frame serialization helpers.
- `backend/server/lib/event-stream/upstream-reader.js`: reusable upstream SSE reader with event-id tracking, stall recovery, and reconnect handling.
- `backend/server/lib/event-stream/runtime.js`: thin WebSocket server runtime for upgrade handling and path dispatch to the global/directory bridges.
- `backend/server/lib/event-stream/protocol.test.js`: unit tests for protocol helpers.
- `backend/server/lib/event-stream/upstream-reader.test.js`: unit tests for upstream SSE reader behavior.
- `backend/server/lib/event-stream/runtime.test.js`: unit tests for runtime-side broadcaster behavior.

## Public exports

### Protocol helpers
- `MESSAGE_STREAM_GLOBAL_WS_PATH`: `/api/global/event/ws`
- `MESSAGE_STREAM_DIRECTORY_WS_PATH`: `/api/event/ws`
- `MESSAGE_STREAM_WS_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS`: heartbeat interval for browser-facing WS connections.
- `parseSseEventEnvelope(block)`: parses an SSE block into `{ eventId, directory, payload }`.
- `sendMessageStreamWsFrame(socket, payload)`: serializes and sends a JSON WS frame.
- `sendMessageStreamWsEvent(socket, payload, options)`: sends an event frame with optional `eventId` and `directory`.

### Runtime helpers
- `createGlobalMessageStreamHub(...)`: creates a shared `/global/event` upstream SSE hub with event/status subscribers and bounded event-id replay.
- `createGlobalUiEventBroadcaster({ sseClients, wsClients, writeSseEvent })`: returns a broadcaster that fans out the same synthetic UI event to SSE and WS clients.
- `createMessageStreamWsRuntime(...)`: mounts the message-stream WS server, upgrade handler, and SSE-to-WS bridge onto the web HTTP server.

### Upstream reader helpers
- `DEFAULT_UPSTREAM_STALL_TIMEOUT_MS`: default idle timeout before an attached upstream SSE fetch is aborted for reconnect.
- `DEFAULT_UPSTREAM_RECONNECT_DELAY_MS`: default delay between upstream reconnect attempts.
- `createUpstreamSseReader(...)`: creates a start/stop reader for OpenCode SSE streams. The reader parses SSE blocks, tracks the latest `Last-Event-ID`, reconnects after closed or stalled upstream streams, and reports events through callbacks.

## Runtime behavior
- Browser clients connect to the WS endpoints above.
- OpenChamber still fetches OpenCode upstream event streams over SSE.
- The web server creates one shared global message-stream hub. OpenCode watcher side effects and global WS clients subscribe to that hub, so there is one upstream `/global/event` SSE reader for both server-side processing and browser fan-out.
- The global hub keeps a bounded replay buffer keyed by SSE `eventId` so reconnecting browser clients can receive buffered events after their requested `Last-Event-ID`.
- Directory WS clients still attach one upstream `/event?directory=...` SSE reader per connection because directory streams are scoped.
- If an upstream SSE stream stalls after the browser WS is already ready, the reader aborts that upstream fetch and reconnects upstream with `Last-Event-ID`, keeping the browser WS alive when recovery is fast.
- When the shared global upstream reconnects after it was previously ready, the global WS bridge sends a fresh `ready` frame to already-ready browser clients. The browser treats this as a reconnect edge and can run scoped state repair without requiring the browser WS to close.
- Health checks are reserved for initial upstream connect failures and explicit upstream-unavailable responses, not for ordinary stall recovery on an already-established stream.
- Global synthetic events such as `openchamber:session-status`, `openchamber:session-activity`, `openchamber:notification`, and `openchamber:heartbeat` are preserved on the WS path, but heartbeat frames are emitted only while an upstream SSE stream is actively attached.
- Global UI broadcasts are fan-out capable across both SSE and WS clients.
- The reusable upstream reader centralizes SSE fetch/parsing/reconnect behavior for the WS runtime and OpenCode watcher. Additional event consumers should move to it only with parity tests for their lifecycle and error semantics.
- Browser transport concerns live in the WS bridge modules; server-side global stream ownership lives in `global-hub.js`.

## Notes for contributors
- Keep protocol helpers pure and small so they can be unit tested without spinning up a server.
- Keep `runtime.js` focused on WebSocket upgrade and endpoint dispatch. Put global browser-client lifecycle in `global-ws-bridge.js`, directory stream lifecycle in `directory-ws-bridge.js`, and upstream stream sharing in `global-hub.js`.
- Do not change upstream OpenCode transport assumptions here; OpenCode remains SSE-based.
- Keep global replay bounded; do not turn it into an unbounded event log.

## Testing
- Run `bun test backend/server/lib/event-stream/protocol.test.js`
- Run `bun test backend/server/lib/event-stream/upstream-reader.test.js`
- Run `bun test backend/server/lib/event-stream/runtime.test.js`
- Run repo validation before finalizing: `bun run type-check`, `bun run lint`, `bun run build`
