# UI Auth Module Documentation

## Purpose
This module owns OpenChamber UI authentication for browser access, including password session auth, WebAuthn passkeys, and trusted-device session handling.

Trusted-device access has one durable credential model: a remote client bearer token stored by `packages/web/server/lib/client-auth/remote-clients.js`. Password, passkey, and Pairing v2 are issuance methods for that credential, not separate credential systems. Issued client tokens are returned once, stored server-side only as hashes, and are later authenticated via `Authorization: Bearer oc_client_...`.

Pairing v2 is implemented by `packages/web/server/lib/client-auth/pairing.js`. It stores short-lived one-time pairing sessions with hashed secrets, exposes create/cancel/redeem routes under `/api/client-auth/pairing/*`, and redeems a valid pairing secret into the same remote client token used by password/passkey trusted-device flows.

## Entrypoints and structure
- `packages/web/server/lib/ui-auth/ui-auth.js`: UI auth controller runtime, cookie/session issuance, rate limiting, and auth route handlers.
- `packages/web/server/lib/ui-auth/ui-passkeys.js`: passkey store and WebAuthn registration/authentication verification helpers.
- `packages/web/server/lib/ui-auth/session-cookie.js`: resolves the session cookie name from a request's `Host` port; shared by the set side (`ui-auth.js`) and the CSRF read side (`packages/web/server/lib/security/request-security.js`).
- `packages/web/server/lib/client-auth/remote-clients.js`: trusted-device client token storage, bearer authentication, last-used tracking, and revocation.
- `packages/web/server/lib/client-auth/pairing.js`: short-lived Pairing v2 sessions and one-time secret redemption into trusted-device client tokens.

## Session cookie scoping
Browsers key a cookie jar on the host only, never the port (RFC 6265). Two OpenChamber instances reached through the same LAN address on different ports (e.g. `http://192.168.0.1:3000` and `:3001`) therefore share a single `oc_ui_session` cookie, and logging into the second silently overwrote the first, logging both tabs out and breaking the CSRF token lookup (issue #2377).

`sessionCookieNameForRequest(req, base)` folds the request `Host` port into the cookie name: `oc_ui_session_<port>` when the host carries an explicit port (including a port from `x-forwarded-host`), or the bare `oc_ui_session` when it does not. Loopback-only setups are unaffected because a browser keeps separate jars for `localhost` vs `127.0.0.1`, and a port-less host keeps the historical name. The **same** function is called on the set side and the CSRF read side so the two can never drift, and `request-security.js` selects the slot for the request's own port when several port cookies arrive together.

Compatibility: upgrading renames the cookie for any explicit-port host, so already-signed-in browser sessions must log in once again. No on-disk format changes.
