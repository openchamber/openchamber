# Git Module Documentation

## Purpose
This module provides Git repository operations for the web server runtime, including repository management, branch/worktree operations, status/diff queries, commit handling, and merge/rebase workflows.

## Entrypoints and structure
- `packages/web/server/lib/git/`: Git module directory containing all Git-related functionality.
  - `index.js`: Public API entry point imported by `packages/web/server/index.js`.
  - `routes.js`: Express route registration for `/api/git/*` endpoints.
  - `service.js`: Core Git operations (repository, branch, worktree, commit, merge/rebase, status/diff, log).
  - `worktree-paths.js`: Worktree naming helpers for shortened worktree root and leaf paths.
  - `credentials.js`: Git credentials management.
  - `identity-storage.js`: Git identity (user.name, user.email) storage.

## Public API

The following functions are exported and used by the web server:

### Repository Operations
- `isGitRepository(directory)`: Check if a directory is a Git repository.
- `getGlobalIdentity()`: Get global Git user.name, user.email, and core.sshCommand.
- `getCurrentIdentity(directory)`: Get local Git identity (fallback to global if not set locally).
- `hasLocalIdentity(directory)`: Check if local Git identity is configured.
- `setLocalIdentity(directory, profile)`: Set local Git identity (userName, userEmail, authType, sshKey/host).
- `getRemoteUrl(directory, remoteName)`: Get URL for a specific remote.

### Status and Diff Operations
- `getStatus(directory)`: Get comprehensive Git status including current branch, tracking, ahead/behind, file changes, diff stats, merge/rebase state.
- `getDiff(directory, { path, staged, contextLines })`: Get diff output for files or entire working tree.
- `getRangeDiff(directory, { base, head, path, contextLines })`: Get diff between two refs.
- `getRangeFiles(directory, { base, head })`: Get list of changed files between two refs.
- `getFileDiff(directory, { path, staged })`: Get original and modified file contents for a single file (handles images as data URLs).
- `collectDiffs(directory, files)`: Collect diff output for multiple files.
- `revertFile(directory, filePath)`: Revert a file to HEAD state.

### Branch Operations
- `getBranches(directory)`: Get list of local and remote branches (filtered to active remote branches).
- `createBranch(directory, branchName, options)`: Create and checkout a new branch.
- `checkoutBranch(directory, branchName)`: Checkout an existing branch.

- `removeWorktree(directory, input)`: Remove a worktree (optionally delete local branch).
- `isLinkedWorktree(directory)`: Check if directory is a linked worktree (not primary).

### Commit and Remote Operations
- `commit(directory, message, options)`: Create a commit (supports addAll or specific files).
- `pull(directory, options)`: Pull changes from remote.
- `push(directory, options)`: Push changes to remote (auto-sets upstream if needed).
- `fetch(directory, options)`: Fetch changes from remote.
- `removeRemote(directory, options)`: Remove a configured remote (except `origin`).
- `deleteRemoteBranch(directory, options)`: Delete a remote branch.

### Log Operations
- `getLog(directory, options)`: Get commit history with stats (supports maxCount, from, to, file filters).
- `getCommitFiles(directory, commitHash)`: Get file changes for a specific commit.

### Merge and Rebase Operations
- `rebase(directory, options)`: Start a rebase onto a target branch.
- `abortRebase(directory)`: Abort an in-progress rebase.
- `continueRebase(directory)`: Continue a rebase after conflict resolution.
- `merge(directory, options)`: Merge a branch into current branch.
- `abortMerge(directory)`: Abort an in-progress merge.
- `continueMerge(directory)`: Continue a merge after conflict resolution.
- `getConflictDetails(directory)`: Get detailed conflict information including operation type, unmerged files, and diff.

### Stash Operations
- `stash(directory, options)`: Stash changes (supports message and includeUntracked options).
- `stashPop(directory)`: Pop and apply the most recent stash.

## Internal Helpers

The following functions are internal helpers used by exported functions:
- `buildSshCommand(sshKeyPath)`: Build SSH command string for git config.
- `buildGitEnv()`: Build Git environment with SSH_AUTH_SOCK resolution.
- `createGit(directory)`: Create simple-git instance with environment.
- `buildSimpleGitOptions(directory)`: Shared `simple-git` defaults including `core.autocrlf=false` and Windows `core.longpaths=true`.
- `normalizeDirectoryPath(value)`: Normalize directory paths (supports ~ expansion).
- `cleanBranchName(branch)`: Remove refs/heads/ or refs/ prefixes.
- `parseWorktreePorcelain(raw)`: Parse `git worktree list --porcelain` output.
- `resolveWorktreeProjectContext(directory)`: Resolve project context (projectID, primaryWorktree, worktreeRoot).
- `resolveCandidateDirectory(...)`: Generate unique worktree directory candidates.
- `worktreeDir(...)`: Build shortened worktree directory paths.
- `resolveBranchForExistingMode(...)`: Resolve branch for existing-mode worktree creation.
- `applyUpstreamConfiguration(...)`: Set upstream tracking for new branches.
- And various other internal helpers for Git command execution and parsing.

## Response Contracts

### Status Response

- `tracking`: Upstream branch (e.g., 'origin/main').
- `ahead`: Number of commits ahead of upstream.
- `behind`: Number of commits behind upstream.
- `files`: Array of file objects with `path`, `index`, `working_dir` status codes.
- `isClean`: Boolean indicating if working tree is clean.
- `diffStats`: Object mapping file paths to `{ insertions, deletions }`.

## Notes for Contributors

### Adding a New Git Operation
1. Add the function to `packages/web/server/lib/git/service.js`.
2. Export the function if it's part of the public API.
3. Use `createGit(directory)` to get a simple-git instance with the correct environment.
4. Use `runGitCommand(cwd, args)` for direct git command execution with better error handling.
5. Use `runGitCommandOrThrow(cwd, args, fallbackMessage)` for commands that must succeed.
6. Return consistent error messages; use `parseGitErrorText(error)` to extract meaningful git errors.
7. Update this file with the new function in the appropriate API section.

### SSH Key Handling
- SSH keys are escaped and validated via `escapeSshKeyPath` to prevent command injection.
- On Windows, paths are converted to MSYS format (`C:/path` → `/c/path`).
- SSH_AUTH_SOCK is automatically resolved via `resolveSshAuthSock` (checks GPG agent, gpgconf).

### Worktree Naming
- Worktree names are slugified via `slugWorktreeName`.
- Worktree roots use shortened project IDs and shortened leaf names via `worktree-paths.js` to reduce Windows path length pressure.
- Random names use adjectives/nouns from `OPENCODE_ADJECTIVES` and `OPENCODE_NOUNS` lists.
- Branches created for new worktrees use `openchamber/<worktree-name>` pattern.

### Cross-Platform Considerations
- Use `normalizeDirectoryPath` for all directory inputs to handle `~` and path separators.
- Use `canonicalPath` for path comparisons to handle case-insensitive filesystems (Windows).
- Use `longPathPrefix()` before direct Node filesystem calls that may hit Windows long-path limits.
- Windows Git commands use MSYS/MinGW paths; avoid direct Windows paths in git commands.

### Error Handling
- All exported functions should throw errors with descriptive messages.
- Use `console.error` for logging Git operation failures.
- Return structured objects for operations that need partial success reporting (e.g., merge/rebase conflicts).

### Testing
- Run `bun run type-check`, `bun run lint`, and `bun run build` before finalizing changes.
- Consider edge cases: non-Git directories, missing remotes, conflict states, concurrent worktree operations.
