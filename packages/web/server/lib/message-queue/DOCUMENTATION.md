# Message Queue

## Purpose

Owns the messages a user queued while a session was busy, and sends them the
moment the session goes idle. The queue lives in the web server so a closed
tab, a locked phone, or a dropped connection no longer strands it. Structural
template: `permission-auto-accept` — the server is authoritative, the shared UI
renders a projection, and VS Code (which has no server of its own) keeps its
UI-side queue and foreground auto-send hook.

## Files

- `runtime.js` — `createMessageQueueRuntime(...)` (state, persistence,
  dispatch loop, event handling) and `registerMessageQueueRoutes(app, runtime)`.
- `runtime.test.js` — delivery, idleness gates, retries, holds, persistence,
  concurrency with in-flight sends, slash commands, and project knowledge.

Wiring: created in `server/index.js` after the global event hub and the
session-knowledge runtime; routes registered in
`opencode/feature-routes-runtime.js` (before the generic OpenCode proxy) with
JSON bodies enabled in `opencode/core-routes.js`; stopped by
`opencode/shutdown-runtime.js`.

## Item

An item is what the UI would have sent itself, captured at queue time so the
send never re-resolves mutable UI state:

```
{
  id, createdAt,
  content,        // raw text for display and editing
  text,           // text to deliver (agent mention stripped, file mentions resolved); defaults to content
  agentMention?,  // delivered as an `agent` part
  attachments: [{ id, filename, mimeType, size, source, serverPath?, dataUrl }],
  context: [      // what the composer had attached, in send order
    { kind: 'context', text, metadata, instructions? },  // a draft chip or linked issue/PR; metadata is the UI's structured payload
    { kind: 'instruction', text },                       // derived from the text (skill instruction)
    { kind: 'synthetic', text },                         // handed to the composer by another surface
  ],
  sendConfig: { providerID, modelID, agent?, variant? }   // required
}
```

The server is a courier for `context`: it validates the shape (a kind it
knows, a `metadata` object on `context` entries) and delivers each entry as a
synthetic text part, an entry's `instructions` going out as its own part just
before it and its `metadata` riding the part verbatim so the timeline renders
the context block back. The payload inside `metadata` is the UI's contract
(`lib/messages/contextParts.ts`), parsed by the UI on the way back.

`parseQueuedItemInput` rejects anything the server could not deliver later
(no text, attachments, or context; missing model; malformed attachment or
context entry). Public snapshots and broadcasts strip the payloads —
attachment `dataUrl` (megabytes of base64) and `context` (a PR diff, say) —
so they do not ride every update; the only way to get them back is a `take`.

## Persistence

`<data-dir>/message-queue.json` (`OPENCHAMBER_DATA_DIR` or
`~/.config/openchamber`): `{ version, revision, sessions: { [sessionId]:
{ directory, items } } }`, written atomically (temp file + rename) through a
serialized write chain. A missing file is an empty queue. A malformed file is
a failure, not an empty queue: it is moved aside as
`message-queue.json.corrupt-<timestamp>` before the runtime starts empty, so
the next write cannot overwrite the user's data. A failed read leaves writes
disabled until a later load succeeds. `revision` is a global monotonic counter
bumped on every mutation; clients use it to reject stale snapshots.

In-memory only, deliberately: the in-flight item (`sendingId`), retry
backoff, abort timestamps, and holds. A restart has no in-flight sends; a
persisted "sending" flag would strand a message forever.

## Delivery loop

1. `start()` subscribes to the global upstream hub and loads the file; on
   load and on every hub `connect` it arms every session that has items.
2. `session.status` for a queued session: `idle` arms a short quiet timer
   (500 ms, coalescing the burst around a turn boundary), `busy`/`retry`
   clears it. A `message.updated` for a completed assistant reply arms as
   well, so a missed idle event cannot strand the queue. `session.deleted`
   drops the session's queue. An assistant `MessageAbortedError` records an
   abort.
3. `tick(sessionId)` bails when the queue is empty, an item is in flight, or
   the session is held. It re-arms after a 2 s post-abort hold (the UI's
   old behavior: a stop is not immediately followed by the next prompt) or
   while the head item is in retry backoff.
4. Idleness is re-verified against OpenCode before sending, because
   `prompt_async` into a running turn steers into it instead of starting the
   next one: `GET /session/status` must not list the session as busy/retry,
   and the trailing message must not be an unfinished assistant reply (the
   status map only lists busy sessions, so a missed busy event leaves no
   entry while a turn still streams). A failed fetch is unknown, never idle:
   the tick re-arms with backoff.
5. The head is marked in flight (broadcast), then sent:
   - text starting with `/` that names a command in OpenCode's `/command`
     list (skills included) goes to `POST /session/:id/command` with the
     captured model, agent, variant, and file parts;
   - otherwise `POST /session/:id/prompt_async` with the parts in the same
     order a UI send uses: text, files, the captured context, pending project
     knowledge (`sessionKnowledgeRuntime.resolvePendingForSession`, synthetic,
     recorded as delivered only after the prompt is accepted), then the agent
     mention. The command path sends files and captured context as `parts`.
   Success removes the item, persists, broadcasts, and marks the user
   message sent for notifications. Failure keeps the item, backs off
   2 s → 60 s (doubling per consecutive failure of that item), and re-arms.
6. The next item goes out after the next busy → idle cycle.

## Holds

Auto-review is driven from the UI and bounces the original session through
idle between iterations; the UI tells the server to hold that session's queue
(`PUT .../hold { held: true, ttlMs? }`) while a run is going and releases it
when the run ends. A hold expires on its own (default 5 min, cap 10 min)
because the UI that asserted it may be gone; the UI re-asserts it every two
minutes while the run continues. Releasing arms a dispatch.

## Routes (`/api/message-queue`)

Normal authenticated OpenChamber runtime routes; never on browser URL-token
allowlists.

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/message-queue` | Full snapshot `{ revision, sessions[] }` |
| `POST .../sessions/:id/items` | Append `{ directory, item }`; returns `{ revision, session, itemId }` and arms a dispatch (the session may already be idle) |
| `DELETE .../sessions/:id/items/:itemId` | Remove; `409` while that item is in flight |
| `POST .../sessions/:id/items/:itemId/take` | Remove and return the full item (payloads included); `404`/`409` |
| `POST .../sessions/:id/take` | Remove and return every item not in flight, in order |
| `PUT .../sessions/:id/order` | `{ itemIds }` must be a complete permutation |
| `DELETE .../sessions/:id` | Clear; the in-flight item stays |
| `PUT .../sessions/:id/hold` | `{ held, ttlMs? }` |

Every mutation broadcasts `openchamber:message-queue.updated` with
`{ revision, session }` to all connected clients (SSE and WS), so several
devices on one server see one queue.

Limits: 20 items per session, 50 sessions (oldest evicted, never one with an
item in flight), 200k characters of content; attachment payloads are bounded
by the route family's 50 MB JSON limit.

## UI ownership

`packages/ui/src/stores/messageQueueStore.ts` is the projection: see its
section in `packages/ui/src/stores/DOCUMENTATION.md`. VS Code intentionally
does not use this module; with all OpenChamber webviews closed, queued
messages there are not delivered.
