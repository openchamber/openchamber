# Composer

The chat composer: the prompt language, the editor that renders it, and
everything between typing and sending.

`ChatInput.tsx` (one directory up) is the orchestrator. It holds the composer's
own state and wires these modules together; it should not grow logic that
belongs to one of them.

## Layers

| Directory | Owns |
|---|---|
| `language/` | What the text *means*: `@` references, `/` and `#` tokens, markdown, and which picker a caret asks for |
| `editor/` | The CodeMirror view that renders the language and owns the caret |
| `state/` | Composer state with a lifecycle: drafts, mobile shell, history, popup placement, draft targeting |
| `submit/` | Turning what the user has into what gets sent |
| `attachments/` | Files: paths, drop payloads |
| `ui/` | Presentation |
| `text.ts` | How inserted text meets the text already there |

## The prompt language

`language/` is the single source of truth for composer syntax. Everything that
needs to know what a token means — highlighting, send-time resolution, and the
autocomplete triggers — goes through it.

**This is the invariant that matters most in this module.** Before it existed,
the `@` rule was written four times with divergent cleanup and the `/` rule
three times with different valid character sets, so a token could be painted as
a reference and then not resolve as one. Adding a construct meant finding every
copy.

- `mentions.ts` — `@` references. The `start..end` span is the reference
  itself and is what gets highlighted; in `see @a/b.ts,` the comma is sentence
  punctuation, not part of the file being referenced. Mentions are plain
  editable text: deleting a character edits the token and reopens the mention
  picker, the same way `/skill` tokens behave — not an atomic delete.
- `prefixTokens.ts` — `/command`, `/skill`, `#snippet`. Scanning is deliberately
  generous; **membership in the command, skill or snippet registry is the
  authority**, not the pattern. An unknown `/token` stays plain prose.
- `triggers.ts` — which picker a caret position asks for. Exactly one can be
  active, with precedence `command > skill > snippet > mention`.
- `tokenize.ts` — one pass producing every highlight range. Adding a construct
  to the language means adding it here, once.

## The editor

`editor/` wraps CodeMirror. The document is a plain string: `getValue()` is
exactly what gets sent, so nothing downstream serializes a rich document model
back into a prompt.

The composer previously painted a transparent `<textarea>` over a mirror
`<div>`. That restricted highlighting to styles which do not change glyph
advance width — colour, background, underline — because anything else made the
mirror drift out from under the caret. Bold and italic were impossible, and the
overlay was disabled outright on mobile, where wrapped text drifted anyway.
**Those constraints are gone**; adding a width-affecting style is now a
question of design, not of feasibility.

Selection rendering: every device runs CodeMirror's `drawSelection()` — it
keeps typing on the drawn-selection code path, and removing it makes
CodeMirror enforce cursor association on the native selection, which iOS
answers with severe input lag. Every device also layers
`composerNativeSelectionExtension` (`editor/theme.ts`) on top: it re-shows
the native selection, and — only while a range is selected — the native caret,
hiding the painted layers those replace. The native selection is the one that
shows for two reasons: the painted layer sits behind the content, so tokens
with their own background (inline code, fences) cover it completely; and
iOS's selection drag handles attach to the visible native selection and take
their colour from the caret, so a transparent caret means invisible handles.
The range-only caret scoping is load-bearing — a native caret visible while
typing makes WebKit re-render its caret UI after every keystroke, felt as
severe input lag. The selection tint comes from `--primary`, not the selection
token:
themes define `--interactive-selection` with its own alpha, so a translucent
mix of it is nearly invisible.

`composerLanguage.ts` retokenizes the whole document on every change. The
composer holds a prompt, not a source file: it is short enough that a full pass
is cheaper and far simpler than incremental mapping, and it keeps the editor
and the send path reading the same grammar.

## Ordering rules worth knowing

- `editor/ComposerEditor.tsx` forwards a click on the composer's padding by
  focusing the view *before* setting the selection: CodeMirror reveals its
  drawn caret through a class it only writes while applying an update, so the
  selection has to be the update that follows the focus.
- `submit/buildOutgoingMessage.ts` flattens queued messages, the composer text,
  inline comments and context into OpenCode's one-primary-plus-parts shape. The
  oldest queued message becomes primary; **inline comments attach to the last
  body the user authored** rather than becoming their own part; PR instructions
  precede the PR diff.
- `state/useComposerDraft.ts` — a draft belongs to a (runtime, directory,
  session) identity. Writes are debounced while typing but forced at every edge
  where the page may stop running, because a pending timer is not a saved
  draft. Two orderings are load-bearing: the debounced write is skipped once
  while a draft is being restored, and a deleted draft's empty signature is
  recorded before a queued write could resurrect it.
- `state/useDraftTarget.ts` — the draft can target a directory that does not
  exist yet (a worktree being created). It must survive not appearing in the
  branch list, or the selector snaps back to the project root mid-creation.

## Mobile

`state/useMobileComposerShell.ts` and `state/useMobileViewportPin.ts` are
mostly not state machines but corrections for specific platform behaviors:
mobile browsers dismissing the keyboard before a tap's click lands, iOS
refusing programmatic focus outside a gesture, WebKit leaving the layout
viewport panned after the keyboard hides, overlay chains handing off through a
frame where nothing is open.

**Every timeout and `flushSync` in them has a reason recorded next to it, and
none of them is verifiable outside a real device.** Change them only against
hardware.

## Testing

The package has no DOM test environment, so coverage stops at the state and
logic layers: the language, the submit assembly, path and drop handling, text
splicing, message history, and the CodeMirror language extension at the
`EditorState` level.

Rendering, focus, keyboard behavior, IME and WKWebView are **not covered by
tests** and are verified by hand. Do not report a change to them as validated
on the strength of type-check and unit tests.

Run tests per file (`bun test <path>`): `mock.module` is process-global, so
suites that install module mocks are order-dependent.
