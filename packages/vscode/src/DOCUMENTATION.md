# VS Code Backend Modules

This document describes backend runtime modules used by the VS Code extension bridge (`packages/vscode/src/bridge.ts`).

## Purpose

Keep `bridge.ts` as a thin orchestration layer that delegates message handling to cohesive domain runtimes while preserving API behavior.

## Runtime modules

- `bridge.ts`
  - Entry orchestration layer for bridge messages.
  - Delegates to specialized runtimes in order and handles only unmatched fallthrough cases.

- `bridge-git-runtime.ts`
  - Standard Git message handlers.
  - Injects the VS Code OpenCode project-command runtime into worktree creation so bootstrap setup mirrors the web server runtime.

- `bridge-git-special-runtime.ts`
  - Specialized Git flows (`pr-description`, `conflict-details`) and generation helpers.

- `bridge-git-process-runtime.ts`
  - Git process execution and environment setup (`execGit`), including SSH agent socket resolution.

- `gitService.ts`
  - Owns VS Code Git and worktree operations.
  - `createWorktree(directory, input, runtime?)` accepts an injected project-command loader. The service executes an authoritative OpenCode `commands.start` value before any extra `startCommand`, treats authoritative empty commands as “do not run project start”, and falls back to legacy project JSON only when the runtime is absent, unavailable, or unmatched.
  - Fast worktree creation reports bootstrap phases explicitly: `directory-created`, then `git-ready` after Git population/upstream work, and `setup-ready` after setup commands. Existing worktrees without tracked bootstrap state fall back to `ready`/`setup-ready`; shared webview consumers also accept legacy responses without `phase`.
  - Worktree removal waits for an active create/bootstrap task for the same directory so background Git and setup work cannot race deletion or restore stale bootstrap state.

- `project-commands-runtime.ts`
  - SDK-backed OpenCode project command lookup for VS Code worktree bootstrap.
  - Creates a fresh `@opencode-ai/sdk/v2` client per lookup from `OpenCodeManager.getApiUrl()` and `getOpenCodeAuthHeaders()`.
  - Matches projects by exact OpenCode project ID first, then normalized explicit worktree path; unmatched or failed API lookups are reported as unavailable for legacy fallback.

- `bridge-fs-runtime.ts`
  - Bridge handlers for filesystem-related message routes.
  - Uses shared FS helpers via injected dependencies.

- `bridge-fs-helpers-runtime.ts`
  - Filesystem/path/search helper functions:
    - path normalization and resolution
    - directory listing
    - file search
    - file read path safety checks
    - dropped-file parsing and attachment reading
    - models metadata fetch helper

- `bridge-localfs-proxy-runtime.ts`
  - Local `/api/fs/read` and `/api/fs/raw` proxy helpers and shared proxy utility helpers.

- `bridge-proxy-runtime.ts`
  - Proxy route handlers (`api:proxy`, `api:session:message`) with injected helper dependencies.

- `bridge-config-runtime.ts`
  - Config and skills message handlers (`api:config/*`).
  - Includes OpenCode resolution diagnostics parity handler used by shared UI (`/api/config/opencode-resolution`).

- `bridge-settings-runtime.ts`
  - Settings read/write and OpenCode skills discovery via API for bridge consumers.

- `bridge-system-runtime.ts`
  - System/editor/provider/quota/notification/update-check message handlers.
  - Includes session activity snapshot bridge handler used by webview parity routes (`/api/session-activity`).
  - Includes Zen utility model parity handler used by shared notification settings (`/api/zen/models`).

- `bridge-permission-auto-accept-runtime.ts`
  - Owns the persisted VS Code permission auto-accept policy and its GET/PUT bridge contract.
  - Broadcasts policy snapshots to every active OpenChamber webview. Permission replies remain foreground UI-owned because VS Code does not run the OpenChamber server runtime.

## Extension guideline

When adding new bridge route families:

1. Prefer creating or extending a domain runtime module under `packages/vscode/src/bridge-*-runtime.ts`.
2. Keep `bridge.ts` focused on delegation order and minimal fallthrough behavior.
3. Inject dependencies into runtimes instead of reaching into unrelated modules directly.
